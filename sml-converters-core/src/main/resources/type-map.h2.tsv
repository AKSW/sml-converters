# Map type names of the dbms to proxy names
# Function declarations may use the proxy names as to not depend on potentially vendor specific names directly 
# Issue: Are proxy names in the same namespace as the database names?
# Suggestion: The namespaces are conceptually disjoint, and the function declaration make use of proxy names
# However, for any database name for which no mapping exists, a proxy with the same name is generated.
# If however such a proxy was already declared for another type, an error is raised.

# Issue: lets assume we call a function f which returns a proxy type of name integer. What would be the corresponding physical sql type?
# Concretely: if we have the expression integer toInt(string), which sql integer type do we use?
# Possible solution: Always use the SQL type that is declared first in the mapping file
